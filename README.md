Integration of Density-based and Partitioning-based Clustering Methods
======

* Use the class p2.datagenerator.DatasetGenerator.java for generating Datasets, per default 2 Datasets are generated.
* Use the class p2.clusteringIntegratedRunner.java to run the integrated Workflow of k-means and DBSCAN.
* Use the class p2.util.Config.java to configure the dataset properties, working directory, plotting, etc.
* Since this is an Eclipse Maven Project, running the classes will work best from an Eclipse workspace.
* See Maven's pom.xml for details concerning the used libraries.
